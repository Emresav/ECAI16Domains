;; this domain is based on a 2D-advanture video game, called Terraria. The objective of this domain is to 
;; find a plan to collect raw materials and produce intermediate products to produce a final product. In this 
;; domain, the final product is 10 beds. the complexity of this problem increased by increasing final product types 
;; and quantity. In addition, some of the problem instances include capacity constraints, which limits number of raw materials collected 
;; regardless of types. For more information about the processes in Terraria, visit Terraria Wiki website. 
;; i.e: http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Bed (process of making a bed is described in this website).
